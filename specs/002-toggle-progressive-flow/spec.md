# Feature Specification: Toggle-Style Progressive Insurance Quote Flow

**Feature Branch**: `002-toggle-progressive-flow`
**Created**: 2025-01-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Toggle-style progressive insurance quote flow with prefill, enhanced rating, and add-ons management based on analysis of Toggle Insurance UX patterns"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Progressive Data Prefill from Existing Policy (Priority: P1)

A customer with existing auto insurance visits the site to get a new quote. Instead of manually entering all vehicle and driver details from scratch, the system automatically retrieves their current policy information from external carrier databases and prefills their quote with existing vehicles and drivers, significantly reducing data entry time.

**Why this priority**: This is the core differentiator of the Toggle flow. It reduces quote completion time by 60-70% and dramatically improves conversion rates. Without this, the feature loses its primary value proposition - the "progressive" aspect of progressive disclosure.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering a last name and ZIP code that matches a mock prior policy in the database, then verifying that vehicles and drivers are auto-populated. Delivers immediate value by eliminating manual data entry for returning or switching customers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a customer with an existing policy from another carrier, **When** they enter their last name and ZIP code on the initial screen, **Then** the system fetches their policy data from external carriers and displays a loading screen with progress indicators showing "Insurance history âœ“" and "Checking vehicle information..."

2. **Given** the system successfully retrieved prior policy data, **When** the loading completes, **Then** the customer is shown a summary screen with their vehicles and drivers already populated in card format, ready for review and editing

3. **Given** no prior policy is found for the entered information, **When** the prefill search completes, **Then** the customer proceeds to a blank quote form to manually enter vehicle and driver information

4. **Given** the customer has multiple vehicles in their prior policy, **When** prefill data is applied, **Then** all vehicles are displayed as separate cards with complete details (year, make, model, VIN)

5. **Given** the customer has additional drivers in their prior policy, **When** prefill data is applied, **Then** all drivers are displayed as separate cards with their relationship and details

---

### User Story 2 - Card-Based Edit-In-Place Quote Modification (Priority: P1)

A customer reviewing their prefilled quote notices that one vehicle's annual mileage is outdated and wants to update it. Instead of navigating through a multi-step form flow, they can click "Edit vehicle" directly on the vehicle's card, make changes in an inline modal or drawer, and see the premium update in real-time on the sticky price sidebar.

**Why this priority**: This is the second core differentiator - the edit-in-place UX pattern. It allows customers to quickly iterate on their quote without losing context or navigating away. Essential for the "progressive disclosure" philosophy where complexity is revealed only when needed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking "Edit vehicle" on any vehicle card, changing a field value (e.g., annual mileage), saving, and verifying the premium recalculates. Delivers value by making quote adjustments fast and intuitive.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a customer viewing the vehicle/driver summary screen, **When** they click "Edit vehicle" on any vehicle card, **Then** an inline edit interface (modal or drawer) opens with all vehicle details editable

2. **Given** the customer makes changes to vehicle information (annual mileage, ownership type, primary driver assignment), **When** they save changes, **Then** the premium recalculates immediately and the sticky price sidebar updates with the new total

3. **Given** a customer editing driver information, **When** they change the driver's age or marital status, **Then** the system applies appropriate rating factors and updates the premium breakdown

4. **Given** the customer clicks "Add vehicle(s)" or "Add another driver", **When** they complete the add form, **Then** a new card appears in the summary with the premium recalculated to include the new risk

5. **Given** the customer has made edits to multiple entities (vehicles and drivers), **When** they navigate to the coverage selection screen, **Then** all their changes persist and the coverage options reflect the updated vehicle/driver lineup

---

### User Story 3 - Enhanced Premium Calculation with Detailed Breakdown (Priority: P2)

A customer wants to understand why their premium is a certain amount and what factors are affecting it. The system provides a comprehensive breakdown showing base premium, rating factors (vehicle age, driver experience, location risk), applied discounts (multi-car, good driver, homeowner), surcharges (accidents, violations), and state taxes/fees - giving full transparency into the pricing.

**Why this priority**: Transparency builds trust and helps customers make informed decisions about coverage levels. This is essential for regulatory compliance and customer satisfaction, but the quote flow can function without detailed breakdowns initially (showing only total premium).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a quote with specific characteristics (e.g., 2 vehicles, clean driving record, homeowner) and verifying the premium breakdown shows expected discounts and the calculation logic is accurate. Delivers value through pricing transparency.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a customer with a clean driving record and multiple vehicles, **When** the system calculates their premium, **Then** the breakdown shows a multi-car discount (10%) and good driver discount (15%) clearly itemized

2. **Given** a customer with a recent accident or DUI, **When** the system calculates their premium, **Then** the breakdown shows appropriate surcharges (accident: 25%, DUI: 50%) applied to the base premium

3. **Given** a customer in a high-tax state, **When** the final premium is displayed, **Then** the breakdown separately shows base premium, total discounts, total surcharges, state premium tax (2-4%), policy fee ($10-25), and DMV fees

4. **Given** a customer adjusting coverage limits on the coverage selection screen, **When** they move a slider or change a dropdown value, **Then** the premium breakdown updates in real-time showing how the coverage change affects each coverage category (bodily injury, property damage, collision, comprehensive)

5. **Given** a customer with vehicles of different ages, **When** the premium breakdown is displayed, **Then** it shows vehicle age factors applied appropriately (newer vehicles have higher comprehensive/collision premiums)

---

### User Story 4 - Smart Missing Data Collection (Priority: P2)

A customer proceeds through the quote flow but has not provided certain required information (e.g., license number, lienholder details for financed vehicles). Instead of blocking progress or showing validation errors mid-flow, the system allows them to continue and then presents a dedicated "missing information" screen that collects only the required fields not yet provided - minimizing interruption and cognitive load.

**Why this priority**: This improves completion rates by avoiding premature validation errors and letting users maintain momentum. However, the quote flow can function with traditional inline validation, making this a nice-to-have rather than critical.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a quote without providing optional-turned-required fields (like lienholder info for a financed vehicle), proceeding to review, and verifying a missing info screen appears requesting only the necessary fields. Delivers value by reducing drop-off from validation friction.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a customer has selected "Financed" as ownership type for a vehicle but not provided lienholder information, **When** they attempt to finalize their quote, **Then** a missing information screen appears requesting lienholder name and address

2. **Given** a customer has not provided driver license numbers for any drivers, **When** they proceed past coverage selection, **Then** the missing information screen lists each driver and requests their license number and state

3. **Given** the customer completes all missing fields, **When** they click "Next", **Then** they proceed to the final review screen with a complete quote ready for binding

4. **Given** the customer provides some but not all missing information, **When** they attempt to proceed, **Then** the system clearly indicates which fields are still required before they can continue

5. **Given** all required information is already provided during the initial flow, **When** the customer proceeds to review, **Then** the missing information screen is skipped entirely

---

### User Story 5 - Vehicle-Specific Add-Ons Management (Priority: P3)

A customer wants to add rental reimbursement coverage to one vehicle but not others, or wants additional equipment coverage for aftermarket accessories on their truck. The system allows them to toggle add-on coverages per vehicle and select coverage amounts, with the premium updating to show the incremental cost for each add-on.

**Why this priority**: Add-ons are revenue-generating but not essential for an MVP quote flow. Customers can get baseline quotes without this feature, making it lower priority than core rating and prefill functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by toggling rental reimbursement for a specific vehicle, selecting an equipment coverage amount ($1,000 or $5,000), and verifying the premium increases appropriately. Delivers value by allowing customers to customize protection per vehicle.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a customer with multiple vehicles, **When** they view the add-ons screen, **Then** each vehicle is listed separately with toggle switches for rental reimbursement and additional equipment coverage

2. **Given** the customer toggles rental reimbursement "on" for one vehicle, **When** the premium recalculates, **Then** the price sidebar shows the incremental cost for that specific vehicle's rental coverage

3. **Given** the customer enables additional equipment coverage, **When** they select the coverage amount ($1,000 or $5,000), **Then** the premium adjusts based on the selected coverage limit

4. **Given** the customer has comprehensive or collision coverage on a vehicle, **When** they view add-ons, **Then** additional equipment coverage is available as an option with amount selection buttons

5. **Given** certain add-ons are always included (roadside assistance), **When** the customer views the add-ons screen, **Then** these are shown as enabled with toggles disabled and labeled "Always On"

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when external carrier API is unavailable during prefill lookup? System should gracefully fall back to manual entry without blocking the quote flow.

- How does the system handle partial prefill data (e.g., vehicles found but no driver information)? Should populate available data and prompt for missing details.

- What happens if a customer's prior policy has 5 vehicles but they only want to insure 2? Should allow removal of prefilled vehicles via "Remove this vehicle" button on cards.

- How does the system handle VIN lookup failures for prefilled vehicles? Should display vehicle with available information and allow manual correction.

- What happens when a customer edits a prefilled vehicle's year/make/model to values that create an invalid VIN mismatch? System should validate and request VIN correction or removal.

- How does the system handle state-specific requirements (e.g., mandatory uninsured motorist coverage in some states)? Should apply state rules automatically and prevent customers from deselecting mandatory coverages.

- What happens when premium calculation fails mid-flow due to missing rating data? Should display user-friendly error message and allow customer to save partial quote for completion later.

- How does the system handle customers switching between "Owned", "Financed", and "Leased" ownership types? Should dynamically show/hide lienholder fields and update premium based on ownership risk factors.

- What happens when a customer adds a driver with a DUI or multiple accidents? Should apply appropriate surcharges and potentially display a message about high-risk status or specialist underwriting review.

- How does the system handle expiration of prefilled quote data? Should maintain quote for 30 days and send reminder emails before expiration.

- How does the system handle mock service failures or timeouts? System should log errors, use fallback defaults (e.g., default safety rating, medium risk driver), and continue quote flow without blocking the customer.

- What happens when VIN decoder returns incomplete data? System should populate available fields and allow customer to manually enter missing vehicle details.

- How does the system handle MVR check failures for drivers? System should default to medium risk level and calculate premium with conservative surcharges, then allow manual override if customer provides proof of clean record.
