- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Specification is complete and ready for planning

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: Specification is completely technology-agnostic. Uses abstract terms like "system," "interface," "database" without mentioning specific technologies (React, NestJS, PostgreSQL, etc.)

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories clearly explain the customer benefit and why each priority level was assigned. Success criteria focus on customer outcomes (completion time, satisfaction) rather than technical metrics.

✅ **Non-technical language**: Written for product managers and business stakeholders. Avoids technical jargon while remaining precise and testable.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements (Functional + Key Entities), and Success Criteria all fully populated with detailed content.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No clarification markers**: Specification makes informed assumptions based on industry standards (e.g., 30-day quote expiration, standard discount/surcharge percentages, state-specific tax ranges). All requirements are fully specified.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Every FR can be validated with specific test cases. Example: FR-001 can be tested by entering last name + ZIP code and verifying search interface appears.

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All 10 SC items include specific metrics (time, percentages, counts). Examples:
  - SC-001: "under 3 minutes" (time-based)
  - SC-002: "40% increase" (percentage-based)
  - SC-005: "1,000 concurrent requests" (volume-based)

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: No mention of API response times, database TPS, or framework-specific metrics. Focused on user-facing outcomes like "quote completion time" and "customer satisfaction."

✅ **Complete acceptance scenarios**: 5 user stories with 5 acceptance scenarios each (25 total), covering happy paths, edge cases, and alternative flows.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 10 edge cases covering API failures, partial data, data validation, state-specific rules, and error handling.

✅ **Clear scope**: Scope is bounded to the quote flow enhancement. Specifically excludes policy binding (already exists in US2) and portal access (US3). Focus is on prefill, edit-in-place UX, and enhanced rating.

✅ **Dependencies/assumptions documented**: Implicit dependencies on existing OMG data model (Person, Vehicle, Policy entities). Assumptions include 30-day quote expiration, standard discount/surcharge rates, mock external APIs for demo mode.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Requirements have acceptance criteria**: All 47 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-047) map to acceptance scenarios in the 5 user stories. Each requirement describes WHAT the system must do, not HOW.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: 5 user stories cover the complete journey from prefill search through add-ons selection, with proper prioritization (P1 for core differentiators, P2-P3 for enhancements).

✅ **Measurable outcomes defined**: 10 success criteria provide clear targets for validation. Mix of time-based (SC-001, SC-004), business metrics (SC-002, SC-007, SC-009), and user satisfaction (SC-003, SC-006).

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Specification successfully avoids technical details. Uses abstract concepts like "database table" instead of "Drizzle schema," "interface" instead of "React component," "calculation" instead of "service method."

## Notes

**Specification is production-ready for `/speckit.plan`**. All checklist items passed validation. The spec provides:

1. **Clear user value**: 5 prioritized user stories with explicit value propositions
2. **Complete requirements**: 47 functional requirements organized by subsystem
3. **Testable acceptance criteria**: 25 acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
4. **Edge case coverage**: 10 edge cases identifying boundary conditions
5. **Measurable success**: 10 quantifiable success criteria

**Assumptions made (industry-standard):**
- 30-day quote expiration period (standard for auto insurance)
- Discount percentages (based on industry benchmarks)
- Surcharge percentages (based on actuarial standards)
- State tax/fee ranges (based on US state regulations)
- Mock external APIs for demo mode (no real carrier integrations)

**Next steps**:
- Run `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
- OR run `/speckit.clarify` if any assumptions need validation (none identified)

**Zero clarifications needed** - all ambiguities resolved with reasonable defaults.
