## Task Dependencies Overview

```
Phase 1 (Setup) → Phase 2 (Foundational) → Phase 3 (US1) → Phase 4 (US2) → Phase 5 (US3) → Phase 6 (Polish)
                        ↓ BLOCKS ALL USER STORIES ↓
```

**Critical Path**:
1. Phase 2 MUST complete before ANY user story work begins
2. US1 (Quote Generation) must complete before US2 (Policy Binding)
3. US2 (Policy Binding) must complete before US3 (Portal Access)
4. Phase 6 (Polish) runs after all user stories complete

---

### ⚠️ OPTION B DESCOPING APPLIED (2025-10-19)

**Context**: After Phase 3 implementation, backend had 63 TypeScript compilation errors. Auto-generated code from T047-T069 (17 services, 5,794 lines) had deep Drizzle ORM incompatibilities and complex interdependencies.

**Decision**: Implemented **Option B - Rewrite Core Services** with simplified architecture.

**What Was DESCOPED** (T047-T069):
- ⏭️ T047-T052: Mock services (VIN decoder, vehicle valuation, safety ratings, delay simulator) - DESCOPED: Not needed for MVP
- ⏭️ T053-T062: Complex rating engine (17 separate calculators, rating tables, audit trail) - DESCOPED: Replaced with simple inline calculation
- ⏭️ T063-T068: 17 specialized services (party-creation, vehicle-enrichment, policy-creation, coverage-assignment, quote-expiration) - DESCOPED: Consolidated into single service

**What Was BUILT** (Option B - NEW):
- ✅ T069a [US1] Create simplified QuoteService with inline CRUD operations at /Users/jasonnguyen/CascadeProjects/auto-prototype-master/backend/src/services/quote/quote.service.ts ✅ 2025-10-19
- ✅ T069b [US1] Create simplified QuotesController with 3 REST endpoints at /Users/jasonnguyen/CascadeProjects/auto-prototype-master/backend/src/api/routes/quotes.controller.ts ✅ 2025-10-19
- ✅ T069c [US1] Create QuoteModule and wire to AppModule at /Users/jasonnguyen/CascadeProjects/auto-prototype-master/backend/src/services/quote/quote.module.ts ✅ 2025-10-19
- ✅ T069d [US1] Fix communication_identity schema (add party_identifier FK) at /Users/jasonnguyen/CascadeProjects/auto-prototype-master/database/schema/communication-identity.schema.ts ✅ 2025-10-19
- ✅ T069e [US1] Fix all field name mismatches in QuoteService (body_style, object_description, licensed_product_name) ✅ 2025-10-19
- ✅ T069f [US1] Fix TypeScript compilation errors (Drizzle ORM type casting, Express middleware types) ✅ 2025-10-19

**Architecture Comparison**:
- Original Plan: 5,794 lines across 17 services (T047-T069)
- Option B Built: ~600 lines in 3 files (QuoteService, QuotesController, QuoteModule)
- Reduction: 90% less code, 100% functional for MVP

**Features Delivered**:
- ✅ POST /api/v1/quotes - Create quote with Party → Person → Vehicle → Policy flow
- ✅ GET /api/v1/quotes/:id - Retrieve quote by quote number (human-readable ID)
- ✅ GET /api/v1/quotes/reference/:quoteNumber - Retrieve quote by reference number
- ✅ Simple premium calculation: Base × Vehicle Factor × Driver Factor × Coverage Factor
- ✅ Quote number generation: **QXXXXX format** (5 alphanumeric chars, e.g., QAUETY, Q3AMNT, Q8ICON)
- ✅ Product auto-creation (Personal Auto Insurance)
- ✅ Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ **All endpoints tested and working** (2025-10-19)

**What Still Needs to Be Built** (Required for Production):

The simplified QuoteService (T069a) provides basic premium calculation, but we still need comprehensive rating features for a production-ready system. These tasks enhance the existing simplified architecture without requiring the complex 17-service approach that was descoped.

### Enhanced Rating Engine Tasks (NEW - Required):
- [ ] T069g [US1] Enhance QuoteService with detailed rating factor calculations (vehicle age multiplier, driver age/experience factors, location zip code risk rating) - add to existing calculatePremium() method at /Users/jasonnguyen/CascadeProjects/auto-prototype-master/backend/src/services/quote/quote.service.ts
- [ ] T069h [US1] Add discount calculations to QuoteService (multi-policy 10%, good driver 15%, anti-theft 5%, low mileage 10%, homeowner 5%, defensive driving 10%, pay-in-full 5%) - extend calculatePremium() at /Users/jasonnguyen/CascadeProjects/auto-prototype-master/backend/src/services/quote/quote.service.ts
- [ ] T069i [US1] Add surcharge calculations to QuoteService (accident 25%, DUI 50%, speeding ticket 15%, at-fault claim 20%, young driver 40%, high-risk vehicle 30%, low credit score 20%, lapse in coverage 10%) - extend calculatePremium() at /Users/jasonnguyen/CascadeProjects/auto-prototype-master/backend/src/services/quote/quote.service.ts
- [ ] T069j [US1] Add state tax and fee calculations to QuoteService (premium tax 2-4% by state, policy fee $10-25, DMV fees per FR-064) - create calculateTaxesAndFees() method at /Users/jasonnguyen/CascadeProjects/auto-prototype-master/backend/src/services/quote/quote.service.ts
- [ ] T069k [US1] Add coverage-level premium breakdown (bodily injury, property damage, collision, comprehensive, uninsured/underinsured motorist, medical payments, rental reimbursement) - create calculateCoveragePremiums() method at /Users/jasonnguyen/CascadeProjects/auto-prototype-master/backend/src/services/quote/quote.service.ts
- [ ] T069l [US1] Persist premium calculation details to Premium Calculation entity (per FR-003) with all rating factors, discounts, surcharges, coverage breakdowns, taxes/fees, timestamp, and quote_id FK for audit trail at /Users/jasonnguyen/CascadeProjects/auto-prototype-master/backend/src/services/quote/quote.service.ts
- [ ] T069m [US1] Update QuoteResult interface to include detailed breakdown (coverageBreakdown, appliedDiscounts, appliedSurcharges, taxesAndFees, subtotal, total) at /Users/jasonnguyen/CascadeProjects/auto-prototype-master/backend/src/services/quote/quote.service.ts

### Optional Enhancements (Can be added later):
- Mock VIN decoder service (T047-T048) - not blocking, can use manual entry
- Vehicle valuation and safety ratings (T049-T050) - nice-to-have for UX
- Quote expiration cron job (T057b) - can be added when scaling
- Coverage detail persistence to Policy Coverage Detail tables (currently simplified)

**Testing Results** (2025-10-19):
- ✅ **POST /api/v1/quotes** - Successfully creates quotes with QXXXXX IDs
  - Example responses: QAUETY ($1,300), Q3AMNT ($1,000), Q8ICON ($1,300)
  - Full OMG entity flow: Party → Person → Communication Identity → Geographic Location → Vehicle → Policy
- ✅ **GET /api/v1/quotes/:id** - Retrieves quote by human-readable ID (e.g., /quotes/QAUETY)
- ✅ **GET /api/v1/quotes/reference/:quoteNumber** - Alternative retrieval endpoint
- ✅ Backend server running stable on port 3000
- ✅ Database schema fully deployed to Neon PostgreSQL
- ✅ Zero runtime errors

**Status**: Backend API is fully functional with basic rating and human-readable IDs ✅. Tasks T069g-T069m required for production-ready comprehensive rating with itemized breakdown (FR-067). Frontend integration can proceed with T070-T080.

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Policy Binding and Payment (Priority P2)

**Goal**: Convert quote to policy with payment and activate coverage (QUOTED → BINDING → BOUND → IN_FORCE)

**Independent Test**: Start with valid multi-driver/vehicle quote (DZXXXXXXXX format), complete payment, get policy number and IN_FORCE status

**Current State**: Quote generation complete with multi-driver/vehicle support, DZXXXXXXXX IDs, 7 API endpoints working, comprehensive rating engine

## Phase 7: Testing & Quality Assurance

**Goal**: Ensure production-ready quality with comprehensive automated tests for critical business logic, API endpoints, and frontend components

**Current State**: Multi-driver/vehicle quote flow working, DZXXXXXXXX IDs, 7 API endpoints functional, comprehensive rating engine with progressive pricing

**Coverage Targets**:
- Backend unit tests: 80%+ coverage for QuoteService business logic
- API integration tests: 100% endpoint coverage (all 7+ endpoints)
- Frontend component tests: Critical user flows (5-page quote wizard, payment, portal)
- E2E tests: Happy path for each user story with multi-driver/vehicle scenarios

**Edge Case Coverage Notes**:
- All test tasks should reference applicable edge cases from spec.md Edge Cases section (lines 73-101)
- Quote flow tests (T168-T172): Cover multi-driver/vehicle scenarios, Progressive quote flow (5 pages), dynamic pricing updates
- Payment tests (T173-T175, T159): Cover Payment & Binding Edge Cases, test both credit card (Luhn) and ACH validation
- Portal tests (T176-T180): Cover DZXXXXXXXX policy number access, multi-driver/vehicle display, claim filing
- Service tests should validate status transitions (QUOTED → BINDING → BOUND → IN_FORCE, not ACTIVE)

**Key Changes from Original Plan**:
- Test multi-driver/vehicle support (additionalDrivers array, vehicles array)
- Test DZXXXXXXXX ID format throughout
- Test Progressive-style 5-page quote flow
- Test comprehensive rating engine (vehicle age, driver age, additional drivers, coverage limits)
- No separate rating engine or mock services files to test (all inline in QuoteService per Option B)
- Test IN_FORCE status (not ACTIVE)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3 (US1) - Parallel Opportunities

**Database Schema Creation (T023-T044)**: All schema files can be created in parallel since they're independent files. Run migrations sequentially afterward (T046).

**Mock Services (T047-T050)**: VIN decoder, vehicle valuation, and safety ratings services can be built simultaneously.

**Rating Engine Components (T053-T057)**: Vehicle, driver, location, and coverage rating calculators are independent and can be parallelized.

**Frontend Pages (T070-T076)**: All quote flow pages and components can be built in parallel, then integrated (T080).

### Phase 4 (US2) - Parallel Opportunities

**Database Entities (T081-T084)**: Payment, Event, Policy Event, and Document schemas can be created simultaneously.

**Mock Services (T086-T089)**: Payment gateway components (Luhn validator, ACH validator, email service) are independent.

**Frontend Pages (T096-T098)**: PaymentInfo, ReviewBind, and Confirmation pages can be built in parallel.

### Phase 5 (US3) - Parallel Opportunities

**Database Entities (T103-T106)**: User Account, Claim, Claim Party Role, and Claim Event schemas are independent.

**Frontend Portal Pages (T114-T118)**: All five portal pages can be built simultaneously.

**Phase 6 - Parallel Opportunities**

**All Polish Tasks (T123-T128)**: Swagger docs, error handling, validation, rate limiting, indexes, and debug panel are independent and fully parallelizable.

- T091: Policy status follows OMG transitions (SC-021)

---

## Notes

- **Testing Tasks Added**: Phase 7 includes comprehensive testing (57 tasks) despite spec not requiring it - aligned with Constitution Principle III (Production-Ready Patterns)
- **Test Coverage Targets**: 80%+ backend unit tests, 100% API integration tests, critical frontend flows, optional E2E tests
- **File Paths**: All paths are absolute as specified
- **Parallelization**: Tasks marked [P] can run concurrently with other [P] tasks in same phase
- **Dependencies**: Phase 2 blocks all user stories; US1 blocks US2; US2 blocks US3; Phase 7 can run in parallel with implementation or after Phase 6
- **OMG Compliance**: All entities follow OMG P&C Data Model v1.0 with UUID primary keys, temporal tracking, and Party Role patterns
- **Demo Mode**: No authentication (URL-based portal access), mock services for external integrations, production-like patterns throughout
- **Test Strategy**: Focus on critical business logic (rating engine, policy lifecycle), API contracts, and user-facing components

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS - YOUR OPTIONS (Updated 2025-10-19)

**Current Status**: Phase 3 US1 backend API complete with human-readable IDs ✅. All 3 endpoints tested and working.

### **Option 1: Frontend Integration (Recommended - Complete US1)**

**Goal**: Connect existing frontend pages to working backend API

**Tasks to Complete**:
- Frontend pages already exist (T070-T079 ✅) but use sessionStorage mock data
- Update useQuote hook to call real API instead of mock data
- Wire up quote flow: VehicleInfo → DriverInfo → CoverageSelection → QuoteResults
- Display real quote data with QXXXXX IDs

**Why this option**: Completes User Story 1 end-to-end, gives you a working demo app

**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours

**Key Files**:
- [src/hooks/useQuote.ts](src/hooks/useQuote.ts) - Already has TanStack Query setup
- [src/services/quote-api.ts](src/services/quote-api.ts) - Already configured for backend
- [src/pages/quote/*.tsx](src/pages/quote/) - Ready for backend integration

---

### **Option 2: Enhanced Rating Engine (Production-Ready Pricing)**

**Goal**: Add comprehensive premium calculations with discounts, surcharges, taxes, and detailed breakdown

**Tasks to Complete**: T069g-T069m
- T069g: Detailed rating factors (vehicle age, driver experience, location risk)
- T069h: 7 discount types (multi-policy, good driver, anti-theft, etc.)
- T069i: 8 surcharge types (accident, DUI, speeding, etc.)
- T069j: State taxes and fees (premium tax 2-4%, policy fee, DMV fees)
- T069k: Coverage-level breakdown (bodily injury, collision, comprehensive, etc.)
- T069l: Persist calculation audit trail to Premium Calculation entity
- T069m: Update API response with detailed breakdown

**Why this option**: Makes pricing realistic and production-ready, adds transparency for users

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

**Key Files**:
- [backend/src/services/quote/quote.service.ts](backend/src/services/quote/quote.service.ts) - Extend calculatePremium() method
- [database/schema/premium-calculation.schema.ts](database/schema/premium-calculation.schema.ts) - Already exists for audit trail

---

### **Option 3: Move to Phase 4 - Policy Binding (User Story 2)**

**Goal**: Convert quotes to active policies with payment processing

**Tasks to Complete**: T081-T102 (22 tasks)
- Create Payment, Event, Policy Event, Document schemas (T081-T085)
- Build mock payment gateway with Stripe test patterns (T086-T089)
- Implement policy binding service with status transitions (T090-T095)
- Create frontend payment/binding pages (T096-T102)

**Why this option**: Advances to next user story, enables full quote-to-policy flow

**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours

**Dependencies**: Frontend integration should be done first to validate US1 fully

---

### **Option 4: Polish & Quality (Make It Production-Ready)**

**Goal**: Add error handling, validation, documentation, and testing

**Tasks to Complete**:
- Add comprehensive API documentation with Swagger (T123)
- Improve error messages and validation (T124-T125)
- Add rate limiting and performance indexes (T126-T127)
- Write tests for QuoteService and API endpoints (T130-T167)

**Why this option**: Improves code quality, makes debugging easier, prevents bugs

**Estimated Effort**: 6-10 hours

**Best paired with**: Option 2 (Enhanced Rating) - polish what's already built

---

### **Option 5: Deploy to Vercel (Show It to the World)**

**Goal**: Get the app running on a public URL for demos/testing

**Prerequisites**: 
- Frontend integration complete (Option 1)
- Backend API stable (✅ already done)

**Steps**:
1. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Deploy frontend via `vercel --prod`
3. Update API URLs to point to deployed backend
4. Test all endpoints in production

**Why this option**: Share with stakeholders, test in real environment, get feedback

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (mostly config)

---

### **My Recommendation**

**Best Path**: 
1. **Option 1 (Frontend Integration)** - 2-4 hours → Complete US1, working demo
2. **Option 2 (Enhanced Rating)** - 4-6 hours → Production-ready pricing
3. **Option 5 (Deploy)** - 1-2 hours → Share with others
4. **Option 3 (Phase 4)** - 8-12 hours → Add policy binding

**Why this order**:
- Frontend integration gives you immediate visible progress
- Enhanced rating makes your demo more impressive (real pricing vs. fake multipliers)
- Deployment lets you share and get feedback early
- Policy binding is a bigger lift, better to do after validating US1

**Fastest Win**: Option 1 (Frontend Integration) - You'll have a fully working quote flow in a few hours!

### **Human-Readable ID Format Reference**

**Current Format**: `QXXXXX` (5 random alphanumeric characters)
- Example quote IDs: QAUETY, Q3AMNT, Q8ICON
- Example policy IDs: PXXXXX (to be implemented in Phase 4)

**Where to Change Format**: 
- [backend/src/services/quote/quote.service.ts:246-257](backend/src/services/quote/quote.service.ts#L246-L257)
- Method: `generateQuoteNumber()`

**Alternative Formats**:
- Date-based: `Q-YYYYMMDD-XXX` (e.g., Q-20251019-ABC)
- Sequential: `Q000001`, `Q000002`
- Longer: `QXXXXXXXX` (8 chars for more uniqueness)
- Custom: Any format you want!

Just modify the `generateQuoteNumber()` method and rebuild - that's it!
