**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: Auto Insurance Purchase Flow
**Branch**: 001-auto-insurance-flow

## Purpose

---

## 1. Backend Technology Stack

### Decision: Node.js + TypeScript + NestJS + Drizzle ORM + Supabase Auth

#### Rationale

**Backend Language: Node.js with TypeScript**
- **Unified Type System**: Sharing TypeScript across frontend (React) and backend eliminates context switching and enables code reuse for OMG entity types, validation schemas, and business logic
- **Developer Experience**: Team already has React 18 + TypeScript expertise; staying in same ecosystem maximizes productivity
- **Performance**: Node.js delivers 2-3x better performance than Python for I/O-bound operations (database queries, API calls), easily meeting <500ms API response requirement
- **Serverless-First**: Native support for Neon's serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Insurance Industry Adoption**: Modern fintech/insurance companies predominantly use Node.js for customer-facing APIs while reserving Python for data science/ML

**Web Framework: NestJS**
- **Enterprise Architecture**: Angular-inspired structure (modules, controllers, services, dependency injection) perfectly matches insurance domain complexity with 27 OMG entities
- **Type Safety Excellence**: First-class TypeScript support with decorators for validation, DTOs automatically enforce data contracts
- **Business Logic Organization**: Dependency injection makes organizing complex rating engine logic, policy rules, and external service mocks effortless
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Built-in `@nestjs/testing` package simplifies mocking services
- **OMG Compliance**: Modular structure allows mapping each OMG entity domain (Party, Policy, Claim) to dedicated modules
- **Documentation**: Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger generation from decorators

**ORM: Drizzle ORM**
- **Type Safety Perfection**: Infers TypeScript types from schema definitions, providing autocomplete and compile-time safety for all 27 OMG entities
- **Performance**: Zero-overhead query builder compiling to raw SQL, fastest Node.js ORM (20-40% faster than Prisma for complex joins)
- **Neon Optimization**: Native `neon-http` and `neon-websockets` drivers designed specifically for Neon's serverless architecture
- **SQL Control**: SQL-like syntax means actuarial logic translates directly to queries
- **Serverless-First**: Minimal bundle size (~7.4KB) and zero runtime dependencies
- **Developer Experience**: Drizzle Studio (GUI) visualizes 27 entities and relationships

**Authentication: None (URL-Based Policy Access)**
- **Demo Simplification**: No authentication layer - users access policies directly via URL with policy number
- **Access Pattern**: Portal accessible at `/portal/{policyNumber}` - e.g., `/portal/POL-2025-123456`
- **Rationale**: Demo application doesn't require user management complexity; simplified flow focuses on insurance business logic
- **Security Note**: Production apps would require authentication; this is intentionally simplified for demonstration
- **User Experience**: After binding policy, user receives confirmation page with direct portal link
- **Implementation**: Simple policy number validation against database, no session management needed

**Testing: Vitest**
- **Performance**: 10-20x faster than Jest in watch mode, critical for TDD with complex premium calculation logic
- **Native TypeScript**: Zero configuration - works with `.ts` files out-of-box
- **Vite Integration**: Frontend uses Vite; Vitest shares same configuration
- **API Compatibility**: 95% Jest-compatible API
- **Modern Features**: Native ES modules, top-level await, import.meta.env

#### Alternatives Considered

**Python (FastAPI/Flask)**
- **Rejected Because**: Type safety limitations (runtime vs compile-time), 2-3x slower performance, context switching with TypeScript frontend
- **Best For**: Data analytics and ML workloads, not API performance

**Go (Gin/Echo)**
- **Rejected Because**: Learning curve for TypeScript-native team, less mature ORM ecosystem, verbosity slows prototyping, overkill for 100-user demo
- **Best For**: Massive scale (>1000 concurrent users), microservices requiring extreme performance

**Express.js**
- **Rejected Because**: Lack of structure becomes liability with 27 entities, no built-in type safety, complex testing setup
- **Best For**: Simple APIs with <10 endpoints, maximum flexibility

**Prisma ORM**
- **Rejected Because**: Performance overhead (20-40% slower), type safety gaps (validates results not queries), schema language less flexible than TypeScript
- **Best For**: Teams prioritizing DX over performance, mature migration tooling

**Authentication Systems (All Rejected for Demo)**
- **Supabase Auth / Clerk / Auth.js**: Unnecessary complexity for demo; adds development time without showcasing insurance domain logic
- **Custom JWT**: Security risks, development overhead, not needed when access is URL-based
- **Best For Production**: Any of these would be appropriate, but demo focuses on insurance features not auth flows

#### Trade-offs

- **NestJS Bundle Size**: ~7MB vs Express's ~500KB (negligible for demo)
- **Learning Curve**: NestJS decorators and DI take 1-2 weeks to master
- **Drizzle Migration Maturity**: Newer than Prisma but improving rapidly
- **No Authentication**: Simplified for demo; production would need full auth system

---

## 2. Portal Access Pattern (No Authentication)

### Decision: URL-Based Policy Access via Policy Number

#### Rationale

**Demo Simplification**
- **No User Management**: Eliminates need for user registration, login, password reset, session management
- **Instant Access**: After binding policy, user receives direct link to portal (e.g., `/portal/POL-2025-123456`)
- **Focus on Insurance Logic**: Development time dedicated to quote generation, rating engine, and policy management rather than auth flows
- **Demonstration Clarity**: Reviewers can instantly access any policy by policy number without creating accounts

**Implementation Pattern**:
```typescript
// Portal Access Route
GET /portal/{policyNumber}

// Backend Validation
async function getPolicyPortal(policyNumber: string) {
  // 1. Validate policy number format (e.g., POL-YYYY-XXXXXX)
  if (!isValidPolicyNumber(policyNumber)) {
    throw new BadRequestException('Invalid policy number format');
  }

  // 2. Look up policy in database
  const policy = await db.query.policies.findFirst({
    where: eq(policies.policyNumber, policyNumber),
    with: {
      coverages: true,
      vehicle: true,
      party: true,
      payments: true,
      claims: true
    }
  });

  // 3. Return 404 if not found
  if (!policy) {
    throw new NotFoundException('Policy not found');
  }

  // 4. Return policy data (no auth check needed)
  return policy;
}

// User Flow After Policy Binding
1. User completes payment and binds policy
2. System displays confirmation page with:
   - Policy number: POL-2025-123456
   - Direct portal link: https://demo.com/portal/POL-2025-123456
   - Downloadable policy documents
3. User bookmarks portal link or saves policy number
4. User can return anytime by entering policy number or using bookmarked link
```

**Production Considerations**:
- **Security Note**: Production applications MUST have authentication. This pattern is intentionally simplified for demo purposes.
- **PII Exposure**: Policy number alone shouldn't grant access in production; would need multi-factor verification (email + DOB, SSN last 4, etc.)
- **Session Management**: Production would use JWT tokens, refresh tokens, session expiration
- **Authorization**: Production would implement role-based access (policyholder, agent, admin)
- **Audit Trail**: Production would log all portal access attempts

**Advantages for Demo**:
- ✅ Instant access without signup friction
- ✅ Shareable policy links for demos/reviews
- ✅ No password reset complexity
- ✅ Faster development (2-3 weeks saved)
- ✅ Simpler testing (no auth token management)

**Disadvantages (Acceptable for Demo)**:
- ❌ Not secure for production use
- ❌ Anyone with policy number can access portal
- ❌ No user identity tracking
- ❌ Can't associate multiple policies to one user

**URL Examples**:
- Portal Dashboard: `/portal/POL-2025-123456`
- Billing History: `/portal/POL-2025-123456/billing`
- File Claim: `/portal/POL-2025-123456/claims/new`
- Claim Details: `/portal/POL-2025-123456/claims/CLM-2025-789`

## 3. Rating Engine Architecture

### Decision: Separate Microservice with Multiplicative Factor Model

#### Rationale

**Architecture: Independent Rating Engine Service**
- **Single Source of Truth**: Rating engine serves as central hub for all pricing. Quote service, policy administration, and other systems make simple API calls
- **Industry Shift**: Insurance industry transitioning from monolithic to decoupled architectures, separating rating, policy, billing, and claims
- **Performance & Scalability**: 100% speed improvements demonstrated by microservices-based rating systems, allows independent scaling
- **Faster Time-to-Market**: 2x faster product launches compared to traditional deployments

**API Design Pattern**:
```typescript
POST /api/v1/rate/calculate
{
  "quoteId": "Q-2025-123456",
  "effectiveDate": "2025-10-17",
  "vehicle": { "year": 2023, "make": "Toyota", "model": "Camry", "isoSymbol": 5 },
  "driver": { "age": 35, "gender": "M", "yearsLicensed": 17 },
  "location": { "zipCode": "90210", "territory": "CA-LA-01" },
  "coverage": { "bodilyInjuryLimit": "100/300", "collision": true }
}

Response: {
  "premium": { "totalPremium": 1248.75, "basePremium": 950.00 },
  "breakdown": { "liability": 625.50, "collision": 423.25 },
  "auditTrail": { "ratingVersion": "2025.Q4.v1", "factorsUsed": {...} }
}
```

**Rating Table Storage: Hybrid Database + Redis Cache**
- **PostgreSQL Source of Truth**: Store rating tables in relational database with full versioning and audit trail
- **Redis Hot Cache**: Sub-millisecond lookups (vs 10-50ms for database), >95% cache hit ratio target
- **Read-Heavy Optimization**: Rating tables read frequently but modified infrequently (perfect caching scenario)
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Database remains authoritative source with complete version history

**Storage Architecture**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE rating_factors (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  factor_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- 'vehicle', 'driver', 'location'
  effective_date DATE NOT NULL,
  expiration_date DATE,
  state_code VARCHAR(2),
  rating_data JSONB NOT NULL,  -- Flexible schema for different factor types
  version VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  INDEX idx_factor_type_effective (factor_type, effective_date)
);
```

**Calculation Performance: Parallel Factor Loading + Aggressive Caching**
- **Parallel Processing**: Load all rating factors simultaneously (50-100ms total vs 200-400ms sequential)
- **Multi-Tier Caching**: L1 Application Memory (0.1ms) → L2 Redis (1-5ms) → L3 PostgreSQL (10-50ms)
- **Database Optimization**: Proper indexes on rating_factors table, JSONB GIN indexes
- **Sub-2-Second Target**: Easily achievable with proper caching (industry benchmarks show sub-3-second for complex calculations)

**Performance Budget**:
- API Request/Response: 50-100ms
- Factor Loading (parallel): 50-150ms
- Calculation: 5-20ms
- Audit Logging (async): 0ms (fire-and-forget)
- JSON Serialization: 10-30ms
- **TOTAL: 115-300ms** ✅ Well under 2-second requirement

**Audit Trail: Event Sourcing with JSONB Events**
- **Complete Calculation Snapshots**: Store all inputs, factors, intermediate steps, and outputs
- **Immutable Append-Only Log**: Regulatory compliance, perfect reconstruction of any past quote
- **Event Schema**: JSONB documents with calculation metadata, rating factors used, calculation steps, performance metrics
- **Retention Strategy**: 7 years in PostgreSQL, archive to S3 Glacier afterward
- **Partitioning**: Monthly partitions for faster queries and easier archival

**Event Structure**:
```typescript
interface CalculationEvent {
  eventId: string;
  timestamp: string;
  quoteId: string;
  inputs: { vehicle, driver, location, coverage };
  ratingFactors: {
    ratingVersion: string;
    vehicleFactor: { value: number, breakdown: {...} },
    driverFactor: { value: number, breakdown: {...} }
  };
  calculationSteps: {
    step1_basePremium: number,
    step2_afterVehicle: number,
    // ... all intermediate steps
    step12_finalPremium: number
  };
  result: { totalPremium: number, breakdown: {...} };
}
```

**Real-Time Premium Updates: WebSockets + GraphQL Subscriptions**
- **Persistent Bidirectional Connection**: Eliminates HTTP polling overhead
- **GraphQL Subscriptions**: Only necessary data changes pushed to client
- **Debouncing**: 300ms client-side wait after user stops changing selections
- **Optimistic UI**: Show estimated premium instantly, replace with accurate calculation
- **Latency Target**: 420-560ms total (debounce + WebSocket + calculation + UI update)

**WebSocket Pattern**:
```typescript
// GraphQL Subscription
subscription OnPremiumUpdated($quoteId: ID!) {
  premiumUpdated(quoteId: $quoteId) {
    totalPremium
    breakdown { liability, collision, comprehensive }
    calculationTime
  }
}

// Mutation triggers recalculation
mutation UpdateCoverage($input: CoverageUpdateInput!) {
  updateCoverage(input: $input) { premium }
}
```

#### Alternatives Considered

**Embedded in Quote Service**
- **Rejected Because**: Tight coupling, can't reuse across systems, harder to version
- **Best For**: Extremely simple pricing logic (<5 factors)

**JSON Files for Rating Tables**
- **Rejected Because**: No versioning, no concurrent updates, difficult audit trail
- **Best For**: Static configuration that never changes

**Database Only (No Cache)**
- **Rejected Because**: Too slow (10-50ms per query), won't meet <2s requirement with complex calculations
- **Best For**: Low-volume systems with simple calculations

**HTTP Polling for Real-Time Updates**
- **Rejected Because**: 500-1500ms latency, wasteful unnecessary requests
- **Best For**: Minimal feature requirements

#### Trade-offs

- **Microservice Complexity**: Additional network hop (~50-100ms), more deployment complexity
- **Redis Dependency**: Need to manage cache lifecycle, potential inconsistency if not handled properly
- **WebSocket Connection Management**: Need to handle reconnects, scale WebSocket servers

## 3. Mock Service Implementation

### Decision: Hybrid In-Memory with File-Based Seed Data + Production-Like Patterns

#### Rationale

**Mock Service Architecture**
- **In-Memory Storage**: Fast response times without database overhead
- **File-Based Seed Data**: JSON/TypeScript files make mock data maintainable, version-controlled, and easy to update
- **Configurable Responses**: Allow different scenarios without code changes
- **Production Patterns**: Retry logic, timeouts, error handling work identically with real APIs

**Realistic Delay Simulation: LogNormal Distribution**
- **LogNormal Distribution**: Most accurately models real-world network latency with occasional outliers
- **Service-Specific Profiles**:
  - VIN Decoder: 300-800ms
  - Vehicle Valuation: 500-1500ms
  - Payment Gateway: 800-2500ms
  - Email Service: 100-400ms
  - Safety Ratings: 400-1200ms
- **Non-Blocking**: Uses Promises, doesn't freeze UI
- **Cache-Aware**: Same request gets similar delay (realistic)

**Error Scenarios: Scenario-Based Configuration**
- **URL/Environment Control**: `?mockScenario=network-issues` activates specific error mode
- **Scenario Presets**:
  - `happy-path`: No errors (demo success flows)
  - `network-issues`: 30% timeouts/failures
  - `validation-errors`: 40% invalid input responses
  - `server-errors`: 30% 500s
  - `realistic`: 5% mixed errors (default)
- **Testability**: QA can easily test all error paths

**VIN Decoder Mock: Checksum Validation + Seed Database**
- **Real VIN Validation**: Luhn-like checksum algorithm provides authenticity
- **Seed Database**: Common vehicles (Honda Accord, BMW X3, etc.) for consistent demos
- **Algorithmic Fallback**: Generates plausible data for unknown VINs using WMI (World Manufacturer Identifier) decoding
- **Format Validation**: 17 characters, no I/O/Q, proper structure

**VIN Validation Logic**:
```typescript
private validateChecksum(vin: string): boolean {
  const VIN_WEIGHTS = [8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 10, 0, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2];
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < 17; i++) {
    sum += transliterate(vin[i]) * VIN_WEIGHTS[i];
  }
  return (sum % 11) === expectedCheckDigit;
}
```

**Payment Gateway Mock: Stripe-Compatible Test Patterns**
- **Industry Standard**: Stripe test card numbers widely recognized
- **Luhn Validation**: Real card number validation algorithm
- **Multiple Scenarios**: Success (4242424242424242), Decline (4000000000000002), Insufficient Funds (4000000000009995), 3DS Required (4000002500003155)
- **ACH Support**: Test routing numbers (110000000 = success, 110000001 = decline)
- **Realistic Validation**: CVV length (3-4 digits), expiry date checks, card brand detection

**Test Card Patterns**:
```typescript
const TEST_CARDS = {
  '4242424242424242': { result: 'success', brand: 'Visa' },
  '4000000000000002': { result: 'decline', code: 'card_declined' },
  '4000000000009995': { result: 'decline', code: 'insufficient_funds' },
  '4000002500003155': { result: '3ds_required' }
};
```

**Caching Strategy: Cache-Aside with TTL**
- **Service-Specific TTLs**:
  - VIN Decoder: 24 hours (rarely changes)
  - Vehicle Valuation: 6 hours (changes throughout day)
  - Safety Ratings: 30 days (rarely changes)
  - Payment: No cache (security)
- **ETag Simulation**: Proper HTTP caching headers
- **Production Pattern**: Code works identically with real cached APIs

**Cache Manager**:
```typescript
class CacheManager {
  private static cache = new Map<string, CacheEntry>();

  static get<T>(key: string, serviceName: string): T | null {
    const entry = this.cache.get(key);
    if (!entry) return null;

    const age = Date.now() - entry.timestamp;
    const ttl = this.TTL_CONFIG[serviceName];

    if (age > ttl) {
      this.cache.delete(key);
      return null;
    }
    return entry.data;
  }
}
```

**Email Service Mock**
- **Sandbox Mode**: Like SendGrid/Mailgun test mode
- **In-Memory Log**: Store sent emails for debugging/testing
- **Email Format Validation**: Regex validation
- **Console Logging**: Dev mode shows all sent emails

#### Alternatives Considered

**Pure In-Memory (No Files)**
- **Rejected Because**: Harder to maintain, data lost on refresh
- **Best For**: Extremely simple mocks with <10 data points

**Database-Backed (SQLite)**
- **Rejected Because**: Overkill for demos, adds deployment complexity
- **Best For**: Mocks that need persistence across restarts

**API Mocking Tools (WireMock, MSW)**
- **Rejected Because**: External dependencies, harder deployment, less educational
- **Best For**: Integration testing, not production demos

**Fixed Delays**
- **Rejected Because**: Unrealistic, doesn't test timeout/retry edge cases
- **Best For**: Deterministic tests requiring exact timing

**No VIN Validation**
- **Rejected Because**: Unrealistic, doesn't catch bad input, less educational
- **Best For**: Minimal viable demo

**No Payment Validation**
- **Rejected Because**: Unrealistic, doesn't demonstrate production patterns
- **Best For**: Quick prototypes

#### Trade-offs

- **In-Memory Resets**: Data lost on page refresh (acceptable for demos)
- **Configuration Complexity**: More setup than simple hardcoded mocks
- **Maintenance**: Need to keep seed data updated

## 4. Database Architecture

### Decision: Neon PostgreSQL with OMG P&C Data Model + UUID Primary Keys

#### Rationale

**Database Platform: Neon PostgreSQL (Serverless)**
- **Serverless Architecture**: Auto-scaling, connection pooling built-in
- **OMG Compatibility**: Full support for relational model with UUIDs, JSONB, temporal tracking
- **Performance**: Sub-500ms query targets achievable with proper indexing
- **Cost-Effective**: Free tier sufficient for demo (10GB storage, unlimited queries)
- **Developer Experience**: Standard PostgreSQL - all tools/libraries compatible

**Schema Design: OMG P&C Data Model v1.0 Compliant**
- **27 Core Entities**: Party, Person, Communication Identity, Geographic Location, Account, Product, Agreement, Policy, Insurable Object, Vehicle, Coverage, Policy Coverage Detail, Policy Limit, Policy Deductible, Policy Amount, Event, Assessment, Claim, Payment, User Account, Document, Rating Factor, Rating Table, Discount, Surcharge, Premium Calculation
- **UUID Primary Keys**: All entities use UUID identifiers per OMG pattern
- **Temporal Tracking**: begin_date, end_date, effective_date, expiration_date on all relationships
- **Party Role Pattern**: Flexible many-to-many relationships with role context (Agreement Party Role, Account Party Role, Insurable Object Party Role, Claim Party Role)
- **Subtype Relationships**: Policy extends Agreement, Vehicle extends Insurable Object, Person extends Party

**Indexing Strategy**:
```sql
-- Performance indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_policy_status ON policy(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_policy_effective_date ON policy(effective_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_party_email ON communication_identity(communication_value) WHERE communication_type_code = 'EMAIL';
CREATE INDEX idx_vehicle_vin ON vehicle(vin);
CREATE INDEX idx_rating_factors_lookup ON rating_factors(factor_type, state_code, effective_date DESC);

-- JSONB indexes for rating data
CREATE INDEX idx_rating_data_gin ON rating_factors USING GIN(rating_data);
```

**Connection Management: Neon PgBouncer**
- **Pooled Connections**: Use `-pooler` connection string for serverless functions
- **10,000 Concurrent Connections**: Far exceeding 100-user demo needs
- **Automatic Scaling**: Neon handles connection pooling automatically

#### Alternatives Considered

**Supabase PostgreSQL**
- **Rejected Because**: Neon specified in requirements, both are excellent
- **Best For**: Projects needing built-in auth, realtime, storage

**MongoDB**
- **Rejected Because**: OMG data model is inherently relational, complex joins needed
- **Best For**: Schemaless documents, simpler data models

**SQLite**
- **Rejected Because**: Single-user, no serverless deployment, limited concurrent connections
- **Best For**: Desktop apps, embedded databases

#### Trade-offs

- **Serverless Cold Starts**: First query after idle period may take 1-2 seconds (acceptable for demo)
- **Connection Limits**: Need to use pooler for serverless functions

---

## 5. Frontend Architecture

### Decision: React 18 + TypeScript + Canary Design System + React Router + TanStack Query

#### Rationale

**Frontend Stack (Established)**
- **React 18.2**: Modern React with concurrent features
- **TypeScript 5.8**: Full type safety from backend to frontend
- **Canary Design System 3.12**: Production-ready UI components
- **React Router 7.6**: Client-side routing
- **Vite 7.0**: Fast development and optimized builds

**State Management: TanStack Query (React Query)**
- **Recommended Addition**: Server state management for quote/policy data
- **Automatic Caching**: Reduces redundant API calls
- **Optimistic Updates**: Instant UI feedback during premium recalculation
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries on failures
- **TypeScript Integration**: Full type inference for API responses

**Real-Time Updates: React Query + WebSockets**
- **TanStack Query**: Manage server state, automatic refetching
- **WebSocket Subscriptions**: Real-time premium updates via GraphQL subscriptions
- **Optimistic UI**: Show estimated premium immediately, replace with accurate value

#### Alternatives Considered

**Redux**
- **Rejected Because**: Overkill for server state, TanStack Query better suited
- **Best For**: Complex client-side state with multiple reducers

**Zustand**
- **Rejected Because**: Good for client state but doesn't handle server state caching/invalidation
- **Best For**: Simple global state without server sync

**Context API Only**
- **Rejected Because**: No built-in caching, refetching, or retry logic
- **Best For**: Simple prop drilling avoidance

#### Trade-offs

- **TanStack Query Learning Curve**: 1-2 days to learn patterns
- **Bundle Size**: ~13KB gzipped (minimal impact)

## 8. Vehicle Data Enrichment Mapping

### Purpose

Define which vehicle attributes are enriched by simulated third-party services (FR-001, FR-044) and fallback behavior for service failures.

---

### VIN Decoder Service Enrichment

**Input**: `vehicle_identification_number` (17-character VIN)

**Enriched Fields** (added to Vehicle entity):
- `make_name` (e.g., "Toyota", "Honda", "Ford")
- `model_name` (e.g., "Camry", "Accord", "F-150")
- `model_year` (e.g., 2020, 2021, 2022)
- `body_style_code` (SEDAN, SUV, TRUCK, COUPE, CONVERTIBLE, WAGON)
- `engine_type` (e.g., "2.5L 4-Cylinder", "3.5L V6")
- `trim_level` (e.g., "LE", "EX", "XLT")
- `manufacturer_name` (e.g., "Toyota Motor Corporation")

**Fallback Behavior**:
1. **Invalid VIN format**: Display validation error "VIN must be 17 alphanumeric characters (excluding I, O, Q)" → Offer manual vehicle entry
2. **VIN not found in mock database**: Display "Vehicle not found in our database" → Provide manual entry form with make/model/year dropdowns
3. **Service timeout** (>2s): Display "Service temporarily unavailable" → Offer retry button or manual entry option

---

### Vehicle Valuation Service Enrichment

**Input**: `make_name`, `model_name`, `model_year`, `mileage` (optional), `zip_code`

**Enriched Fields**:
- `market_value_amount` (estimated current market value)
- `replacement_cost_amount` (new vehicle replacement cost)
- `valuation_source_code` (JD_POWER, KBB, NADA)
- `valuation_date` (timestamp of valuation)

**Fallback Behavior**:
1. **Valuation data unavailable**: Use default estimate formula: `base_msrp * (1 - (0.15 * vehicle_age))` → Display disclaimer "Estimated value based on vehicle age"
2. **Service timeout**: Use depreciation table lookup by make/model/year → Mark valuation as "ESTIMATED"
3. **Exotic/rare vehicle**: Prompt user for manual market value entry → Allow override with $5,000-$500,000 range validation

---

### Safety Rating Service Enrichment

**Input**: `make_name`, `model_name`, `model_year`

**Enriched Fields**:
- `overall_safety_rating` (1-5 stars, NHTSA scale)
- `frontal_crash_rating` (1-5 stars)
- `side_crash_rating` (1-5 stars)
- `rollover_rating` (1-5 stars)
- `iihs_top_safety_pick` (boolean)
- `standard_safety_features` (array: ABS, ESC, Airbags, BSM, etc.)

**Fallback Behavior**:
1. **No safety data for model year**: Display "Safety ratings not available for this model year" → Allow quote to proceed without safety rating discount
2. **Older vehicles** (<2010): Skip safety rating enrichment → Use default risk factor (no discount or penalty)
3. **Service unavailable**: Proceed without safety data → Exclude safety-based rating adjustments from premium calculation

---

### Enrichment Orchestration Flow

```
1. User enters VIN or selects vehicle manually
   ↓
2. IF VIN provided → Call VIN Decoder (with fallback)
   ↓
3. With make/model/year → Call Vehicle Valuation (parallel)
   ↓
4. With make/model/year → Call Safety Ratings (parallel)
   ↓
5. Merge all enriched data into Vehicle entity
   ↓
6. Validate all required rating fields present
   ↓
7. Proceed to premium calculation
```

**Performance Targets**:
- VIN Decoder: 500ms-1s (95th percentile)
- Valuation + Safety (parallel): 1-2s total (95th percentile)
- Total enrichment: <3s for full VIN lookup flow

**Mock Service Implementation Notes**:
- VIN decoder uses Luhn-like checksum validation for realistic VIN validation
- Seed database with ~100 common vehicles (top makes/models by market share)
- Valuation service uses MSRP depreciation curves by vehicle class
- Safety ratings pulled from NHTSA 2015-2025 data patterns
- All services implement LogNormal latency distribution for realistic timing
- Cache vehicle data with 24-hour TTL to simulate production caching patterns

## 9. Mock Payment Gateway Scenarios

### Purpose

Define realistic payment gateway behavior for demo application (FR-008), including validation rules, success/failure scenarios, and error responses.

---

### Credit Card Payment Scenarios

**Validation Rules** (Luhn Algorithm):
- Card number must pass Luhn checksum validation
- Expiration date must be future date (MM/YY format)
- CVV must be 3-4 digits
- ZIP code must match billing address format

**Success Scenarios** (Stripe Test Card Patterns):

| Card Number | Scenario | Response Time | Result |
|-------------|----------|---------------|--------|
| 4242 4242 4242 4242 | Standard success | 1-2s | Payment approved, transaction ID generated |
| 5555 5555 5555 4444 | Mastercard success | 1-2s | Payment approved |
| 3782 822463 10005 | Amex success | 1-2s | Payment approved (CVV 4 digits) |

**Decline Scenarios**:

| Card Number | Decline Reason | Error Code | User Message |
|-------------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| 4000 0000 0000 0002 | Card declined | card_declined | "Your card was declined. Please try a different payment method." |
| 4000 0000 0000 9995 | Insufficient funds | insufficient_funds | "Insufficient funds. Please use a different card or contact your bank." |
| 4000 0000 0000 0069 | Expired card | expired_card | "Your card has expired. Please use a different card." |
| 4000 0000 0000 0127 | Incorrect CVC | incorrect_cvc | "The security code is incorrect. Please check and try again." |
| 4000 0000 0000 0119 | Processing error | processing_error | "An error occurred processing your payment. Please try again." |

**Validation Error Scenarios**:

| Invalid Input | Error Response | User Message |
|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| Invalid Luhn checksum | invalid_card_number | "The card number is invalid. Please check and try again." |
| Expired date (past) | invalid_expiry_date | "The expiration date is in the past." |
| Invalid CVV length | invalid_cvc | "The security code must be 3-4 digits." |
| Missing required field | incomplete_request | "Please fill in all required fields." |

---

### ACH Bank Account Payment Scenarios

**Validation Rules**:
- Routing number must be 9 digits (valid ABA routing number)
- Account number must be 4-17 digits
- Account type: checking or savings

**Success Scenarios**:

| Routing Number | Account Number | Response Time | Result |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| 110000000 | 000123456789 | 2-3s | ACH authorized, pending verification |
| 011401533 | 000987654321 | 2-3s | ACH authorized |

**Failure Scenarios**:

| Routing Number | Account Number | Error Code | User Message |
|----------------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| 110000000 | 000000000000 | invalid_account | "The bank account number is invalid." |
| 999999999 | 000123456789 | invalid_routing | "The routing number is invalid. Please verify with your bank." |
| 110000000 | 999999999999 | account_closed | "This account appears to be closed. Please use a different account." |

### Timeout and Network Error Scenarios

**Simulated Network Conditions**:
- **Normal processing**: 1-3 seconds (LogNormal distribution, mean=2s)
- **Slow network**: 5-8 seconds (10% probability)
- **Timeout**: >10 seconds, return timeout error (2% probability)
- **Network error**: Connection refused (1% probability)

**Error Responses**:

| Scenario | Response Time | Error Code | User Message | Retry Behavior |
|----------|---------------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| Slow processing | 5-8s | N/A | "Processing payment..." (loading state) | Auto-complete when done |
| Timeout | 10s+ | request_timeout | "Payment processing timed out. Please try again." | Allow retry |
| Network error | Immediate | network_error | "Unable to connect to payment processor. Please check your connection." | Allow retry |

### Payment Processing State Machine

```
INITIATED → VALIDATING → PROCESSING → [SUCCESS | DECLINED | ERROR]
                ↓              ↓
           VALIDATION_ERROR  TIMEOUT
```

**States**:
1. **INITIATED**: User submits payment form
2. **VALIDATING**: Client-side validation (Luhn, expiry, CVV format) - 100ms
3. **PROCESSING**: Simulated gateway processing - 1-3s (LogNormal)
4. **SUCCESS**: Payment approved, policy binding proceeds
5. **DECLINED**: Payment declined, user prompted to retry
6. **VALIDATION_ERROR**: Invalid input, immediate user feedback
7. **TIMEOUT**: Request exceeded 10s, allow retry
8. **ERROR**: Processing error, allow retry with different payment method

### Mock Service Implementation Details

**Response Structure** (JSON):
```json
{
  "status": "success | declined | error",
  "transaction_id": "txn_1234567890abcdef",
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "card | bank_account",
    "last4": "4242",
    "brand": "visa | mastercard | amex | discover"
  },
  "amount": 120000,
  "currency": "usd",
  "created": 1634567890,
  "error": {
    "code": "card_declined",
    "message": "Your card was declined.",
    "decline_code": "generic_decline"
  }
}
```

**Tokenization** (PCI Compliance Simulation):
- Real card numbers never stored in database
- Generate mock payment method token: `pm_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
- Store only: last 4 digits, brand, expiry month/year, token
- Display masked number: `**** **** **** 4242`

**Testing Configuration**:
- Environment variable `MOCK_PAYMENT_SCENARIO` can force specific outcomes
- Values: `always_succeed`, `always_decline`, `random` (default)
- Allows testing error handling without relying on specific card numbers
