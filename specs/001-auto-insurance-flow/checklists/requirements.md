## Validation Summary

**Date Validated**: 2025-10-17

All validation checks passed. The specification has been updated to include full OMG Property & Casualty Data Model v1.0 compliance.

**Major Updates from Product Requirements**:
- Added OMG P&C Data Model v1.0 standard compliance
- Expanded Key Entities to include all 17 OMG core entities with detailed descriptions
- Added 16 OMG-specific functional requirements (FR-021 through FR-036)
- Enhanced Success Criteria with OMG compliance metrics (SC-018 through SC-021)
- Expanded Assumptions with OMG compliance, database architecture, security, and scope boundaries
- Added industry standardization and interoperability documentation
- Clarified demo application approach with mock payment gateway (realistic simulation, no real transactions)
- Updated payment-related requirements to specify mock payment processing with production-like behavior
- Specified demo-friendly email delivery (in-app preview, notification center, or sandbox email service)
- Updated email requirements to generate/display messages without actual email delivery to arbitrary addresses
- Added simulated third-party vehicle data service integrations (VIN decoder, vehicle valuation, safety ratings)
- Added 8 vehicle data integration requirements (FR-037 through FR-044)
- Added 6 third-party integration simulation success criteria (SC-022 through SC-027)
- Expanded edge cases to include vehicle data lookup scenarios (invalid VIN, timeout, missing data)
- Enhanced self-service portal to include billing/payment history viewing and claims filing capabilities
- Added 10 self-service portal requirements (FR-045 through FR-054)
- Added 7 portal-specific success criteria (SC-028 through SC-034)
- Added Claim, Claim Party Role, and Claim Event entities to OMG data model
- Updated scope boundaries to clarify claims filing is IN SCOPE (claims processing/adjudication OUT OF SCOPE)
- Added 6 portal-specific edge cases (claim validation, upload failures, document generation)

**Clarifications Resolved**:
- Quote expiration period: Set to 30 days from quote creation (industry standard)
