/**
 * Rating Engine Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
 *
 * DTOs are like "forms" that define exactly what data should look like
 * when it comes into the API (Request DTOs) and goes out (Response DTOs).
 *
 * Think of DTOs as:
 * - REQUEST DTOs = Forms you fill out to submit data
 * - RESPONSE DTOs = Receipts you get back with information
 *
 * Why use DTOs?
 * 1. Type Safety: TypeScript knows exactly what fields exist
 * 2. Validation: We can validate data matches the expected shape
 * 3. Documentation: Other developers know what to send/expect
 * 4. Consistency: All API responses follow the same patterns
