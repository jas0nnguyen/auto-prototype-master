# Phase 2: Foundational Infrastructure (Tasks T013-T022)

**Completed**: 2025-10-18
**Goal**: Build the database foundation and core utilities that enable all user story work.

**CRITICAL**: This phase BLOCKS all user stories - no quote, policy, or portal features can be built until Phase 2 completes.

## What We Built

### 1. Database Connection (T013)
- Created `backend/src/database/connection.ts` - handles PostgreSQL connection to Neon
- **What it does**:
  - Configures connection pooling for efficient database access
  - Provides both pooled (for queries) and unpooled (for migrations) connections
  - Tests database connection on startup
- **Key functions**:
  - `createNeonClient()`: Creates SQL client for queries
  - `createNeonPool()`: Creates connection pool for Drizzle ORM
  - `testConnection()`: Validates database is accessible
- **Analogy**: Like setting up plumbing in a building - connects your application to the database "water supply"

### 2. Drizzle ORM Configuration (T014)
- Created `backend/src/database/drizzle.config.ts` and root `drizzle.config.ts`
- **What it does**: Configures Drizzle ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for type-safe database queries
- **Benefits**:
  - Write TypeScript code instead of raw SQL
  - Compile-time type checking (catch errors before running)
  - Automatic TypeScript type inference from database schema
- **Analogy**: Like having a translator that converts your English (TypeScript) to the database's language (SQL) automatically

### 3. Migration Framework (T015)
- Created migration structure in `database/schema/` and `database/migrations/`
- Added base schema utilities in `database/schema/_base.schema.ts`
- **What it does**:
  - Provides system for versioning database schema changes
  - Generates SQL migrations from TypeScript schema definitions
  - Tracks which changes have been applied to database
- **Key patterns**:
  - `auditTimestamps`: Standard created_at/updated_at fields
  - `temporalTracking`: OMG begin_date/end_date pattern
  - `effectiveDates`: Policy/Agreement effective/expiration dates
- **Analogy**: Like Git for your database structure - tracks changes and applies them in order

### 4. Base Entity Types (T016)
- Created `backend/src/entities/base/index.ts` with foundational types
- **What it does**: Defines common interfaces and enums used by all entities
- **Key exports**:
  - `BaseEntity`: Interface with created_at/updated_at
  - `TemporalEntity`: Adds begin_date/end_date for validity tracking
  - `EffectiveDatedEntity`: Adds effective_date/expiration_date for contracts
  - Enums for status codes, party roles, coverage types, etc.
- **Analogy**: Like defining the basic building blocks (LEGO bricks) that all more complex structures will use

### 5. NestJS Database Module (T017)
- Created `backend/src/database/database.module.ts`
- Updated `backend/src/app.module.ts` to import DatabaseModule
- **What it does**:
  - Makes database connection available to all services via dependency injection
  - Tests connection on application startup (fails fast if database unreachable)
  - Closes connections gracefully on shutdown
- **Dependency Injection**: NestJS pattern where services "request" dependencies instead of creating them
- **Analogy**: Like a central electrical panel that distributes power to all rooms in a building

### 6. OMG Entity Interfaces (T018)
- Created `backend/src/types/omg-entities.ts` with ALL 33 entity interfaces
- **What it does**: Defines TypeScript types for every OMG entity in the system
- **Entity breakdown**:
  - 5 Party entities (Party, Person, Communication Identity, Geographic Location, Location Address)
  - 3 Account & Product entities (Account, Product, User Account)
  - 9 Policy & Coverage entities (Agreement, Policy, Coverage, Policy Coverage Detail, etc.)
  - 2 Insurable Object entities (Insurable Object, Vehicle)
  - 4 Party Role relationships (Agreement Party Role, Account Party Role, etc.)
  - 1 Payment entity
  - 3 Event entities (Event, Policy Event, Claim Event)
  - 2 Claim entities (Claim, Claim Party Role)
  - 1 Document entity
  - 6 Rating Engine entities (Rating Factor, Rating Table, Discount, Surcharge, Premium Calculation)
- **OMG Compliance**: All entities follow naming conventions (e.g., `party_identifier` not `id`)
- **Analogy**: Like creating detailed blueprints for every type of LEGO structure you'll build

### 7. Validation Utilities (T019)
- Created `backend/src/utils/validators.ts` with 20+ validation functions
- **What it does**: Provides reusable functions to validate data before saving to database
- **Key validators**:
  - `isValidUUID()`: Validates UUID format
  - `isValidEmail()`: Email format validation
  - `isValidVIN()`: Vehicle VIN validation with checksum
  - `isValidCreditCard()`: Luhn algorithm for card validation
  - `isValidDriverAge()`: Must be 16+ years old
  - Policy/Quote/Claim number format validators
- **Analogy**: Like quality control inspectors at a factory checking that each part meets specifications

### 8. Error Handling Middleware (T020)
- Created `backend/src/api/middleware/error-handler.ts`
- Updated `backend/src/main.ts` to use global error filter
- **What it does**:
  - Catches ALL errors thrown anywhere in the application
  - Converts them to consistent JSON error responses
  - Logs errors with appropriate severity levels
  - Hides sensitive error details in production
- **Custom error types**:
  - `ValidationError`: Bad input data
  - `NotFoundError`: Resource doesn't exist
  - `BusinessRuleError`: Violated business logic
  - `DatabaseError`: Database operation failed
- **Analogy**: Like a safety net that catches falling acrobats and gives them a soft landing

### 9. Response Formatters (T021)
- Created `backend/src/utils/response-formatter.ts`
- **What it does**: Ensures ALL API responses follow the same structure
- **Response types**:
  - `success()`: Standard success response with data
  - `error()`: Standard error response with code and message
  - `paginated()`: Success response with pagination metadata
  - `validationError()`: Formatted validation failures
  - `notFound()`: 404 error responses
- **Consistency benefits**: Frontend always knows what to expect
- **Analogy**: Like standardized packaging - every product (API response) comes in the same box format

### 10. CORS and Security (T022)
- Created `backend/src/api/middleware/cors.ts`
- Updated `backend/src/main.ts` to apply CORS and security headers
- **What it does**:
  - Configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (allows frontend to call backend)
  - Adds security headers to protect against common attacks
- **Security headers**:
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`: Prevents clickjacking
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`: Prevents MIME sniffing attacks
  - `X-XSS-Protection`: Enables browser XSS protection
  - Cache-Control: Prevents sensitive data caching
- **CORS config**: Allows localhost in dev, restricts origins in production
- **Analogy**: Like security checkpoints and protective walls around a building

## Key Concepts Learned

**Drizzle ORM** = Type-safe database query builder
- Defines schema in TypeScript
- Generates migrations automatically
- Provides compile-time type checking for queries
- Alternative to raw SQL or ORMs like Prisma/TypeORM

**Dependency Injection** = How NestJS shares resources
- Services "request" dependencies instead of creating them
- Central module provides instances
- Easier testing (can swap in mock databases)
- Singleton pattern ensures one database connection pool

**Middleware** = Functions that run before/after requests
- Error handling middleware catches exceptions
- CORS middleware checks request origins
- Validation middleware checks request data
- Runs in order: CORS → Validation → Route Handler → Error Handler

**Type Safety** = Catching errors at compile time
- Interfaces define what data looks like
- TypeScript checks types before code runs
- Prevents "undefined is not a function" errors
- Drizzle infers types from schema automatically

**OMG Data Model** = Industry standard for insurance data
- Standardized entity names (Party not Customer, Agreement not Contract)
- Standardized relationships (Party Role pattern)
- Temporal tracking (begin_date/end_date)
- Enables interoperability with other insurance systems

## What We DIDN'T Build Yet

- ❌ Actual database schema definitions (Phase 3 - will use interfaces from T018)
- ❌ API routes/endpoints (Phase 3+)
- ❌ Business logic services (Phase 3+)
- ❌ Mock services (Phase 3+)
- ❌ Frontend-backend integration (Phase 3+)

## Why Phase 2 Was Critical

Phase 2 provided the **data layer foundation**:
1. ✅ Database connection configured
2. ✅ ORM configured for type-safe queries
3. ✅ All entity types defined (33 entities)
4. ✅ Validation utilities ready
5. ✅ Error handling standardized
6. ✅ Response formatting consistent
7. ✅ Security middleware in place

**Without Phase 2**, we couldn't:
- Save data to the database (no connection)
- Write type-safe queries (no ORM)
- Know what data structures look like (no entity types)
- Validate input data (no validators)
- Handle errors gracefully (no error middleware)
- Return consistent responses (no formatters)

## The Restaurant Analogy Continued

Phase 2 is like **installing the kitchen infrastructure**:
- ✅ Connected to water supply (database connection)
- ✅ Installed gas lines and electrical (ORM, modules)
- ✅ Bought measuring cups and thermometers (validators)
- ✅ Set up quality control procedures (error handling)
- ✅ Designed standard plate presentation (response formatters)
- ✅ Established health & safety protocols (CORS, security)
- ✅ Created recipe cards for every dish (entity interfaces)
- ❌ Haven't bought the ingredients yet (database seeds)
- ❌ Haven't started cooking yet (business logic)
- ❌ Haven't served any customers yet (API endpoints)

## Next Steps: Phase 3 Preview

Phase 3 will build **User Story 1: Quote Generation**:
1. Create actual database schema files using Drizzle
2. Run migrations to create database tables
3. Build rating engine for premium calculation
4. Create mock services (VIN decoder, vehicle valuation)
5. Implement quote service (create, read, update quotes)
6. Build quote API endpoints
7. Connect frontend quote pages to backend

**Phase 3 is unblocked** because Phase 2 provided all the foundational infrastructure needed.

**Total Progress**: 22/170 tasks complete (13%)
