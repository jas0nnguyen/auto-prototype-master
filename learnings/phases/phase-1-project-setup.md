# Phase 1: Project Setup (Tasks T001-T012)

**Completed**: 2025-10-18
**Goal**: Set up the kitchen before cooking - prepare the workspace, tools, and configuration.

## What We Built

### 1. Folder Structure (T001-T003)
- Created `backend/` directory with organized subdirectories for entities, services, API routes, database, and utilities
- Created `database/` directory for schema definitions, seed data, and migrations
- **Analogy**: Like organizing an office building with different departments (HR, Finance, Sales) before hiring employees

### 2. Backend Package Configuration (T004-T006)
- Created `backend/package.json` with NestJS, Drizzle ORM, and testing dependencies
- **What it does**: Lists all the libraries (pre-built code) we need and defines shortcuts for common commands
- **Key dependencies**:
  - `@nestjs/core`: The foundation framework for building the backend
  - `drizzle-orm`: Tool to talk to the database in TypeScript
  - `vitest`: Testing framework to ensure code works correctly
- **Analogy**: Like a shopping list for a restaurant - lists all ingredients and kitchen equipment needed

### 3. TypeScript Configuration (T007)
- Created `backend/tsconfig.json` with strict type safety rules
- **What it does**: Sets grammar rules for TypeScript code - enforces type checking, enables path aliases
- **Key settings**:
  - `strictNullChecks`: Forces you to check if something exists before using it (prevents crashes)
  - `noImplicitAny`: Forces you to specify data types explicitly (catches errors early)
  - `paths`: Shortcuts for imports (e.g., `@entities/*` instead of `../../../entities/*`)
- **Analogy**: Like spell-check and grammar rules for writing - catches mistakes before they become problems

### 4. NestJS Entry Point (T008)
- Created `backend/src/main.ts` - the "ignition key" that starts the backend server
- **What it does**:
  - Enables CORS (allows frontend to talk to backend)
  - Sets up validation (checks incoming data is correct)
  - Configures Swagger (automatic API documentation)
  - Starts the server on port 3000
- **Analogy**: Like turning the key to start your car engine - initializes everything and gets the server running

### 5. App Module (T009)
- Created `backend/src/app.module.ts` - the blueprint for the entire application
- **What it does**: Defines which modules are loaded and how they connect
- **Current state**: Only loads ConfigModule (for environment variables), other modules will be added in later phases
- **Analogy**: Like a building blueprint showing all the rooms and how they connect

### 6. Frontend-Backend Bridge (T010)
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to proxy API requests from frontend to backend
- **What it does**: When frontend calls `/api/quotes`, Vite forwards it to `http://localhost:3000/api/quotes`
- **Why needed**: Frontend runs on port 5173, backend on port 3000 - the proxy bridges them
- **Analogy**: Like a receptionist who forwards your call to the right department

### 7. TanStack Query Integration (T011)
- Added `@tanstack/react-query` to frontend `package.json`
- **What it does**: Smart cache manager for API data - remembers previous requests, auto-refreshes, handles loading states
- **Benefits**: Less code to write, automatic caching, optimistic updates
- **Analogy**: Like upgrading from manually checking your mailbox to having smart notifications

### 8. Environment Configuration (T012)
- Enhanced `.env.example` with backend API settings, mock service configuration, and logging options
- **What it does**: Documents all the settings/secrets the app needs (database passwords, API keys, etc.)
- **Key sections**:
  - Backend server settings (port, environment)
  - Mock service delays (simulates realistic API response times)
  - CORS configuration (which frontends can connect)
  - Rate limiting (prevents abuse)
- **Analogy**: Like a template for a safe's combination - shows what secrets you need without revealing the actual secrets

## Files Created/Modified

```
✅ Created:
- backend/src/main.ts (server entry point)
- backend/src/app.module.ts (app blueprint)
- backend/package.json (dependencies list)
- backend/tsconfig.json (TypeScript rules)
- backend/README.md (documentation)
- .gitignore updates (ignore backend build files)

✅ Modified:
- package.json (added TanStack Query)
- vite.config.ts (added API proxy)
- .env.example (added backend settings)

✅ Directories Created:
- backend/src/{entities, services, api, database, utils}
- backend/tests/{unit, integration}
- database/{schema, seeds, migrations}
```

## Key Concepts Learned

**Package.json** = Shopping list + instruction manual
- Lists what libraries you need
- Defines commands you can run (`npm run start:dev`, `npm test`)

**TypeScript Configuration** = Grammar rules for code
- Enforces type safety (prevents bugs)
- Sets up path aliases (cleaner imports)
- Configures compiler options (how TS converts to JS)

**NestJS Main Entry** = Ignition key for the server
- Initializes the application
- Sets up middleware (CORS, validation)
- Starts listening for requests

**App Module** = Building blueprint
- Defines which modules are loaded
- Sets up dependency injection
- Configures global services

**Vite Proxy** = Call forwarding system
- Forwards `/api/*` requests from frontend (port 5173) to backend (port 3000)
- Solves CORS issues during development

**Environment Variables** = Configuration settings
- Stores secrets and settings outside code
- Different values for development vs production
- Loaded from `.env` files

## What We DIDN'T Build Yet

- ❌ Database connection (Phase 2)
- ❌ Entity definitions (Phase 2)
- ❌ API routes/endpoints (Phase 3+)
- ❌ Business logic/services (Phase 3+)
- ❌ Actual insurance features (Phase 3+)

## Next Steps: Phase 2 Preview

Phase 2 will build the **foundation** that everything else depends on:
1. Connect to Neon PostgreSQL database
2. Configure Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries
3. Define all 33 OMG entity interfaces (Party, Policy, Vehicle, Coverage, etc.)
4. Create validation utilities and error handlers
5. Set up database modules and connection pooling

**Why Phase 2 is critical**: No user story work can begin until Phase 2 completes - it provides the data layer that all features need.

## The Restaurant Analogy

Phase 1 is like **setting up a restaurant before opening day**:
- ✅ Built the kitchen (backend structure)
- ✅ Organized the pantry (folder structure)
- ✅ Got the equipment (dependencies)
- ✅ Hired the head chef (NestJS framework)
- ✅ Connected gas and electricity (configuration)
- ✅ Set up the phone system (Vite proxy)
- ❌ Haven't created the menu yet (API routes)
- ❌ Haven't hired the cooks yet (business logic)
- ❌ Haven't opened the doors yet (no features implemented)

**Total Progress**: 17/170 tasks complete (10%)
